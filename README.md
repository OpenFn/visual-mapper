# visual_mapper

Given a "composite destination schema" the user wants to be able to create or update records in a destination database.

We'd like to use https://github.com/jdorn/json-editor to present the user with a simple webform.

The user can type values, or use values from a "source_schema" so that when a submission arrives from that source, the data in the submission is used to populate the correct fields in the destination.
