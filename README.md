# visual_mapper

Objective
-----------
Open-source Zapier/IFTTT "mapping generator" to provide automation services to the international development sectorâ€”current projects are in public health, agriculture, and education.

Stories will be documented as github issues. The epic is this:
-------------------------
1. Given a schema in "JSON-schema" the user wants to be able to define an action (create or update records) in a destination database.

We'd like to use JSON-editor (https://github.com/jdorn/json-editor) to present the user with an HTML webform to define the insert/update action.

This webform will allow the user to type values for each field in the destination schema(s).

This webform will also allow the user to insert `placeholders` from a `source schema` that tells us what to expect from a triggering event.

	i.e., When a new patient record is created in the mobile clinic system, create a new outbound SMS record in the sms gateway.

These are effectively "ingredients" in an If-This-Then-That recipie.
